Elevated blood pressure (hypertension) could signify heightened risks for cardiovascular diseases such as stroke and heart ailments. Decreased blood pressure might imply circulatory issues or undisclosed health problems.\n",

Larger LDL cholesterol levels correlate with augmented chances for heart maladies while higher HDL cholesterol levels act as protection.\n",
